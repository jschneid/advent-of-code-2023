Python 3 solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2023

This is my first time ever writing Python code! Pointers on how to make any of this code more Pythonic are welcome!

Shout-out to my nephew https://github.com/Wolverine1621, who proactively turned me on to Python [comprehensions](https://python-3-patterns-idioms-test.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Comprehensions.html) and [f-strings](https://fstring.help/) when I told him I was giving Python a try for this year's AoC!
